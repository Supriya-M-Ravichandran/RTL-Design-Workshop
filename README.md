### INTRODUCTION TO VERILOG RTL DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS

_Register Tranfer Level_ is a low-level abstraction to represent a design circuit. RTL design facilitates the designers by automating the design process. It converts the functionality of a design circuit written in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) into equivalent combinational and sequential circuit. 
Fundamentally, Design is the actual Verilog code of set of Verilog codes which has intended functionalities to meet the specifications. RTL design is also checked for adherence to specification by simulating the design. While a _Simulator_ is used to verify or check the design, _Testbench_ is the setup to apply stimulus to the design to check its functionality. 

### DESIGN AND TEST BENCH MODULES

>_**Note:** Design module may have one or more primary inputs and primary outputs. However, testbench will not have any primary input or output._  

### SIMULATION FLOW

> _**Note:** sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop Directory has: My_Lib - which contains all the necessary library files; where lib has the standard cell libraries to be used in synthesis and verilog_model with all standard cell verilog models for the standard cells present in the lib. Ther verilog_files folder contains all the experiments for lab sessions including both verilog code and test bench codes._ 

### MULTIPLEXER REVIEW

![Screen Shot 2021-09-04 at 4 50 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/132090267-473a8ae1-ec52-4979-9e60-5cc0b05a0e6e.png)

#### _Mux - Working:_
The multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational logic circuit which is designed to switch one of the several input lines through to a single common output. The input A acts to control which input (either I0 or I1) gets passed to the output Q. A good mux - when the data select input A is at logic 0, input I1 passes its data to the output, while I0 is blocked. When the input is at logic 1, input I0 passes its data to the output, while I1 is blocked. Output Expression is given as Q = A'I1 + A I0.

### GOOD MUX IMPLEMENTATION USING IVERILOG

```
#Steps Followed:
//Load the design in iVerilog by giving the verilog and testbench file names
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v 
//List so as to ensure that it has been added to the simulator
$ ls
//To dump the VCD file
$ ./a.out
//To load the VCD file in GTKwaveform
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```
>_**Note:** The invoking command for iVerilog should have both source and testbench Verilog files. Once this command is run, it creates a.out file which dumps the vcd file. GTKwave viewer is used to open the vcd dump file and analyze the waveform._

### GTKWave ANALYSIS

![Screen Shot 2021-09-01 at 3 49 04 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131778505-5929cc06-72a2-4d20-ae16-4c4cc72e0730.png)

>_**Note:** GTKWave is the waveform analyzer and is the primary tool used for visualization and thereby to check the design functionality._

### ACCESSING MODULE FILES

Additionally, the verilog and test bench modules can be accessed using the following command: 
```
$ gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v 
```

>_**Note:** Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. gvim brings all the functionality, power, and features of Vim while adding the convenience and intuitive nature of a GUI environment._

### INTRODUCTION TO YOSYS AND LOGIC SYNTHESIS
Synthesizer (Yosys) is the tool that helps to convert RTL to netlist. Netlist is the representation of the design in the form of standard cells (in the form of the cells present in the .lib). Design and netlist file should be one and the same. Logic synthesis is the optimiztion stage during the CAD process where the RTL code is being transformed into netlist. 

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 11 10 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131879381-e7f010a5-545d-49a8-ae76-6d60ed221732.png)

#### _But, How to Verify the Synthesis Output?_
The stimulus should be same as the output observed in the RTL simulation. The design was written in Verilog code and netlist is the standard cell representation of the code. The set of primary inputs and primary outputs will remain the same between the RTL design and synthesized netlist. It implies that, we can use the same testbench as RTL design.

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 11 00 19 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131877685-e2bba5af-59ac-4817-ab84-fb07556676da.png)

#### _Logic Synthesis_
RTL Design is the behavioral representation in HDL form for the required specification.

But How to map the code with the hardware circuit? Synthesis - RTL to gate level translation. The design is converted into gates and the interconnections are made between the gates. This is given out as a file named as netlist. We take the RTL design, combine with .lib and synthesis it to get the netlist file. 

>_**Note:** .lib file is a collection of logical modules which includes all basic logic gates. It may also contain different flavors of the same gate (2 input AND, 3 input AND â€“ slow, medium and fast version)._

#### _Cell Selection_
Fast and Slow cells comes with its own advantages and disadvantages when we consider the critical delays in combinational circuits. It is necessary to guide the synthesizer for selecting the cells that is optimum for implementing the logic circuits. This is called as _Constraints._ 

>_**Note:** Faster Cells lead to increased area and power, potentially leading to hold time violations. Slower Cells will result in slow circuits and may fail to meet the performance._

### DESIGN LOGIC SYNTHESIS 

```
#Steps Followed:
//Invoke Yosys
$ yosys
//Read library 
$ read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__t_025C_1v80.lib

```
//Steps Followed:

/cell .*and
//To open variations of and cell in parallel

```

>_**Note:** AND2_4 implies that it is a wider cell compared to the other two. Hence, it has more area and power specifications. It also has the least delay. On the other hand, AND2_0 - cell with least area and power has bigger delay._

### HIERARCHICAL SYNTHESIS

>_**Observation:** The realization after show command is different from the expected Realization of the file. The instants of the sub-modules u1 and u2 are seen instead of the the AND and OR gates. This is called as Hierarchical Design where the hierarchies are preserved._

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 9 28 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131941557-4dcd0693-a89c-4cda-a5ee-3cd572b6a665.png)

>_**Observation:** There is an interesting note on how the OR gate is realized through De-Morgan's Law. The Synthesis tool has chosen NAND implementation. This is because, for a NAND gate in CMOS implementaion - there is a stacked NMOS structure. For realising OR gate - there is a stacked PMOS structure. Stacking PMOS will have negative effects (since they need good logical efforts due to poor mobility of holes). Hence there is a need for wide cell to put in the logical efforts._

### FLAT SYNTHESIS

```
//Steps Followed:
//To flatten the netlist
$ flatten
//Writing the netlist in a crisp manner and to view it
$ write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
$ !gvim multiple_modules_flat.v
```

>_**Observation:** There is no hierarchy preserved here and the gates are directly instantiated under module multiple_module without being called under the sub-module._

### SUB MODULE LEVEL SYNTHESIS

#### _Need for Sub-module level Synthesis:_
Sub-module level synthesis is preferred when there are multiple instances of same module. Sythesizing the same module over several times may not be advantageous with respect to time. Instead, synthsis can be performed for one module, its netlist can be replicated and then stitched together in the top module. This is also used particulary in massive designs using divide and conquer method. 

```
//Steps Followed:
//Invoke Yosys
$ yosys
//Read library 
$ read_liberty -lib ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib
//Read Design
$ read_verilog multiple_modules.v
//Synthesize Design - this controls which module to synthesize
$ synth -top sub_module1
//Generate Netlist
$ abc -liberty ../my_lib/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd_-tt_025C_1v80.lib
//Realizing Graphical Version of Logic for single modules
$ show 
//Writing the netlist in a crisp manner 
$ write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
$ !gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
```

>_**Note:** The gates that are instantiated under submodule 1 can only bee seen._

### FLIP FLOP OVERVIEW

In a digital design, when an input signal changes state, the output changes after a propogation delay. All logic gates add some delay to singals. These delays cause expected and unwanted transitions in the output, called as _Glitches_ where the output value is momentarily different from the expected value. An increased delay in one path can cause glitch when those signals are combined at the output gate. In short, more combinational circuits lead to more glitchy outputs that will not settle down with the output value. 

>_Hence, there is a need to store the values called as flop elements. D Flip-flops (aka Data or Delay Flip Flops) are the widely storage elements used to restrict the glitches._
 
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131943529-8b90a84b-d745-48c1-9e3d-3876c4050a5e.png)


Flop elements stores a single bit of data - with either of the states 0 and 1. They are placed inbetween the combinational circuits and the output of flop will change at the edge of clock. Though it's input is glitchy, the output is stable. That way, the successive combinational circuit will receive a stable intput and its output will also be predictable and settled down.  

#### _How to Code the Flip Flop:_
Every flop element needs an initial state, else the combinational circuit will evaluate to a garbage value. In order to achieve this, there are control pins in the flop namely: Set and Reset which can either be Synchronous or Asynchronous. 

#### _Asynchronous Reset/Set:_

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 10 11 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131946717-7cdd0aeb-369a-4ade-b6d2-b9b7fc51b13e.png)
![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 10 16 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131947092-dd26c7ca-25c2-48d0-9841-d9e0ad5d5a66.png)


>_**Note:** Here, always block gets evaluated when there is a change in the clock or change in the set/reset.The circuit is sensitive to positive edge of the clock. Upon the signal going low/high depending on reset or set control, singal q line goes changes respectively. Hence, it does not wait for the positive edge of the clock and happens irrespective of the clock_.

#### _Synchronous Reset:_

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 10 19 42 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131946706-2222f473-89bc-4a2a-85df-3ffb0c01e77e.png)

>_**Note:** Here, the singal waits for the clock always and is always set to D Pin of flop. The D pin will wait for the positive edge of the clock and on the subsequent occurence, the output changes respectively. The sensitivity list only contains posedge clk_. 

#### _Both Synchronous and Asynchronous Reset:_

![Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 10 28 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/131946998-d79712a6-2c72-44ae-95c2-596372b3365c.png)

>_**Note:** Care needs to be taken when using the Set and Reset control pins and they may lead to race conditions. The always block is evaluated for positive edge of clock and asynchronous reset. The execution of else if implies that the always block has been evaluated because of the positive edge of the clock_. 

### FLIP FLOP SIMULATION

```

### LOGIC CIRCUITS OVERVIEW

There are two types of digital logic circuits - _combinational and sequential logic circuits_. **_Combinational circuits_** are collection of basic logic gates, where the output depends only on the current inputs and do not require any clocks. They result in a simple circuit capable of implementing complex logic using logic gates only. **_Sequential circuits_** are collection of memory elements calls as flip-flops. The circuit's output depends on current input as well as the past intputs. Due to the presence of flip-flops, the output requires clock inputs. Hence, they result in a complex circuit capable of implmenting complex logic using memory.  

#### _Combinational Logic Optimization Techniques_

Logic optimization is a part of logic synthesis to find an equivalent representation of the specified logic circuit under one or more specified constraints. We perform in order to squeeze the logic and get the most optimized design which can lead to area and power savings. This can be achieved through Constant Propoation Method (Ex: Direct Optimisation) or through Boolean Logic Optimization (ex: K-Map or Quine-McCluskey Methods). In Constant Propogation, most optimized logic is obtained by propogating the value of one input is to the next stage and all the way to the output. In Boolean Logic Optimization, synthesis tools reduce complex logic equations to simplied version using boolean algebra/K-map reductions. 

#### _Sequential Logic Optimization Techniques_

One of the most basic Optimization Techniques for sequential circuits is the constant propogation method. At times of logic design when D input is tied Low, in order to optimize the sequential logic, the Q pin of flop should always have a constant value. There are also advanced techniques to obtain a most condensed state machine: 1) State Optimization where the unused states are being optimized. 2) Cloning way of logic is done during physical aware synthesis (where if two flops are sitting far off - there might be a large routing delay. To prevent this, a flip flop with huge positive slack can be cloned and the timing can be met). 3) Re-timing - the combinational logic is partitioned effectively to reduce the delay, thereby increasing the frequency of operation. Hence, the performance of the circuit is improved using this technique.

>_**Note:** If there is a reset, the counter is intialised to 0, else it is incremented - performing like an upcounter. Since it is a 3 bit signal, the counter rolls back after 7. However, the final output q is sensing only the count [0], so the bit is toggling in every clock cycle (000, 001, 010 ...111). The other two outputs are unused and does not create any output dependency. Hence, these unused outpus need not be present in the design._

### GATE LEVEL SIMULATION

#### _What is GLS?_

Previously, the functionality of the design was given stimulus inputs and the output was verified to meet the specifications through a test bench module. The RTL design was considered as the DUT (Design Under Test). In Gate Level Simulation, the Netlist is considered as the Design Under Test.  Netlist is logically same as the RTL code that was converted to Standard Cell Gates. Hence, same test bench will align with the design. 

#### _Advantages of GLS:_

* To logically verify the correctness of the design after Synthesis.
* During the RTL Simulation, timing was not accounted. But for practical applications, there is a need to ensure the timing of the design to be met. 

![Screen Shot 2021-09-04 at 12 54 53 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/132105880-e47f3d07-d920-4d0a-ab03-1b3c7b3da68d.png)

```
//consider a netlist
and uand (.a(a),.b(b))
or uor (.a(a),.b(b))
//There is a need to define the meaning of and and or
//Thus we need netlist, testbench and verilog models of the standard cells
```

>_**Note:** Netlist consists of all standard cells instantiated and it's meaning is conveyed to the iVerilog using Gate Level Verilog Models. Gate Level Verilog Models can be functional or timing aware. If the gate level models are delay annotated, then GLS can be performed for timing validation also in addition to functional validation._

### SYNTHESIS SIMULATION MISMATCH

If netlist is a true reciprocation of RTL, what is the need to validate the functionality of netlist? There may be synthesis and simulation mismatch due to the following reasons: 
1. Absence of Sensitivity List
2. Blocking Vs Non Blocking Assignments
3. Non Standard Verilog Coding

#### _Absence of Sensitivity List:_

```
module mux(
input i0,input i1
input sel,
output reg y
);
always @ (sel)
begin
   if (sel)
            y = i1;
   else 
            y = i0;          
end
endmodule
```

The output of Simulator changes only when the input changes. The output is not evaluated when there is no activity. In the above 2x1 mux code, when select is changing (when select is 1), the output is 1 when input is 1 else the output is 0. The always block evaluates only when there is a transition change in select pin, and is not sensitive (output does not reflect) to changes in the inputs 0 and 1. 

|Time|Logic|
|:---:|:---:|
|During Simulation|Logic acts as a Latch/Double edged Flop|
|During Synthesis|Logic acts as a Mux|

**_Hence there is a Synthesis Simulation mismatch due to missing sensitivity list. This is because the synthesizer will not take sensitivity list into account and always looks for the functionality of the code._**

#### _Corrected code for missing sensitivity list:_

```
module mux(
input i0,input i1
input sel,
output reg y
);
always @ (*)
begin
   if (sel)
            y = i1;
   else 
            y = i0;        
end
endmodule
```

>_**Note:** Thus the mismatch is corrected by having always @ (*) where the always block is evaluated when any signal changes. So, any changes in inputs will also be seen in the output._

#### _Blocking Vs Non Blocking Statments in Verilog:_

#### _CAVEAT 1:_

The error always occurs when inside an always block. **_Blocking Statements_** executes the statements in the order it is written. The first statement is always evaluated before second statement (like a C program). **_Non-Blocking Statements_** executes the statements in parallel. All the right hand side assignments will be evaluated before assigning to the left hand side. 

|Assignment|Statement|
|:---:|:---:|
|=|Blocking Statment|
|<=|Non-Blocking Statment|

```
module code (input clk,input reset,
input d,
output reg q);
always @ (posedge clk,posedge reset)
begin
if(reset)
begin
        q0 = 1'b0;
        q = 1'b0;
end
else
        q = q0;
        q0 = d;    
end
endmodule
```

![Screen Shot 2021-09-04 at 2 46 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/132106366-2faa1e5a-738b-4782-a550-4fe8dfc4aef2.png)

The code is aimed to create a shift register when two flops as shown above. The assignments inside the code represent the blocking statements. q0 and q are assigned to 1 bit 0s - so asynchronous reset connection happens. However, in the later parts, q0 is assigned to q and then d gets assigned to q0. If suppose, there is a change in the code

```
module code (input clk,input reset,
input d,
output reg q);
always @ (posedge clk,posedge reset)
begin
if(reset)
begin
        q0 = 1'b0;
        q = 1'b0;
end
else
        q0 = d;
        q = q0;    
end
endmodule
```

In this case, d is assigned to q0 and then q0 is assigned to q. So, by the time the second statment gets executed, q0 has the value of d. This will lead to implementation of only one flop. Previously, q has the value of q0 and q0 has the value of d - which lead to implementation of 2 storage elements. 

#### _Usage of non-blocking statements:_

```
module code (input clk,input reset,
input d,
output reg q);
always @ (posedge clk,posedge reset)
begin
if(reset)
begin
        q0 <= 1'b0;
        q <= 1'b0;
end
else
        q0 <= d;
        q <= q0;   
end
endmodule
```

**_Therefore the order does not matter here as RHS gets evaluated first and then assignment takes place. Presence of two flops irrespective of the order. Always use non blocking statements for writing sequential circuits._**

#### _CAVEAT 2: Causing Synthesis Simulation Mismatch_

```
module code (input a,b,c
output reg y);
reg q0;
always @ (*)
begin
        y = q0 & c;
        q0 = a|b ;    
end 
endmodule
```

The code is aimed to create a function of y = (A+B).C. In the above code, when the code enters always block, due to the presence of blocking statements, they get evaulated in order. So y gets evaluated first (q0.C), where the q0 results corresponds to the previous iteration's result. The q0 value gets updated only in the second statement. 

|Time|Logic|
|:---:|:---:|
|During Simulation|Logic mimcs a delay or flop|
|During Synthesis|Logic will not have a flop|

When the order of the statements is changed: In this case, a OR b is evaluated first and the latest value is used for calculating y. 

```
module code (input a,b,c
output reg y);
reg q0;
always @ (*)
begin
        q0 = a|b ;
        y = q0 & c;
end 
endmodule
```

**_Therefore there is a paramount importance to run the GLS on the netlist and match the specifications, to ensure there is no simulation synthesis mismatch._**

>_**Expected Behavior:** The sensitivity list contains only select input. So during Simulation, the logic acts as a latch and during synthesis, it acts as a mux._

>_**Observation:** When select is low, it follows i0, and there is no activity happening in select line - so the output remains low. When the select is high, it follows i1, and again there is no activiting in the select line. Thus it acts as a flop, retaining its value._

>_**Observation:** Confirms the functionality of 2x1 mux after synthesis where when the select is low, activity of input 0 is reflected on y. Similarly, when the select is hight, activity of input 1 is reflected on y. Hence there is a synthesis simulation mismatch due to missing sensitivity list._

>_**Expected Behavior:** In the above code, when the code enters always block, due to the presence of blocking statements, they get evaulated in order.

### IF STATEMENTS

#### _Why IF Statements?_

The if statement is a conditional statement which uses boolean conditions to determine which blocks of verilog code to execute. If always translates into Multiplexer. It is used for priority Logic and are always used inside always block.The variable should be assigned as a register.

#### _Syntax for IF Statement_

```
if<cond>
begin
.....
.....
end
else
begin
.....
.....
end
```
#### _Syntax for IF-ELSE-IF Statement_

```
if<cond1>
begin
.....
 executes cb1
.....
end
else if<cond2>
begin
.....
  executes cb2
.....
end
else if<cond3>

```

#### _Hardware Implementation_

>_**Note:** Condition 1 gets the highest Prority, If the condition1 is met - other conditions are not evaluated. LegN gets evaluated only if all the conditions precedding fail to meet._

#### _Cautions with using IF Statements_

**_Inferred latches_** can serve as a 'warning sign' that the logic design might not be implemented as intended. They represent a bad coding style, which happens because of incomplete if statements/crucial statements missing in the design. For ex: if a else statement is missing in the logic code, the hardware has not been informed on the decision, and hence it will _latch_ and will tried retain the value. This type of design should be completely avoided unless intended to meet the design functionality (ex: Counter Design). 

![Screen Shot 2021-09-04 at 4 45 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89927660/132108796-8cfdeb80-4f84-4cfe-8b2a-f061fbe139d5.png)

>_**Note:** Combinational circuits cannot have an inferred latch._

### CASE STATEMENTS

#### _CASE Statements_
The hardware implementation is a Multiplexer. Similar to IF Statements, Case statements are also used inside always block and the variable should be a register variable. 

#### _Syntax_

```
reg y
always @ (*)
begin
	case(sel)
		2'b00:begin
		      ....
		      end
		2'b01:begin
		      ....
		      end
		      .
		      .
		      .
	endcase	
end
```

#### _Caveats in CASE Statements_

1. Case statements are dangerous when there is an incomplete Case Statement Structure may lead to inferred latches. To avoid inferred latches, code Case with default conditions. When the conditions are not met, the code executes default condition.

```
reg y
always @ (*)
begin
	case(sel)
		2'b00:begin
		      ....
		      end
		2'b01:begin
		      ....
		      end
		      .
		      .
	default:begin
         ....
		       end
	endcase	
end
```

2. Partial Assignments in Case statements - not specifying the values. This will also create inferred latches. To avoid inferred latches, assign all the inputs in all the segments of the case statement. 

#### _Comparison between If - Else If - Else If - Else Vs Case_

|If - Else If - Else If - Else Structure|Case Structure|
|:---:|:---:|
|Undergoes concept of priority.|No priority of segments in case structure|
|Only one segment of the code will execute as it follows top-bottom approach sequentially.|May lead to Unpredictable outputs in bad case structures as there may be more than one segment executing the code. Thus, we should not have overlapping case statements.

>_**Observation:** When select signal is 00, the output follows i0 and is i1 when the select value is 01. Since the output is undefined for 10 and 11 values, the presence of default sets the output to i2 when the select line is 10 or 11. The ouput will not latch and be a proper combinational circuit.

>_**Expected Behavior:** There is a partial case structure with output of x undefined for one of the select values, so a latch is not expected._

>_**Observation:** The mux for output y will not have a latch, while there will be a latch for mux with output x as one of the conditions is not defined_

>_**Expected Behavior:** Although the case structure is not complete, there is overlapping of output when the select input is 10 or 11 and ? represented that the bit can be wither 0 or 1. Thus, the simulator may be confused._

>_**Observation:** The observed waveform in simulation and synthesis matches and conforms code functionality._

#### _CASE 3: demux using generate if statement.v_

>_**Note:** The experiment of using demux with generate if statement functions same as of demux with case statement. However, the advantage of using generate if statements is the number of lines in the code which almost remains the same even if the input lines in demultiplexer increases._
